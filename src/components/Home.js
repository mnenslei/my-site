                <p>I graduated from the Bloom Institute of Technology (fka Lambda School) in May 2022 and from Indiana University-Bloomington, Kelley School of Business in 2018.</p>
                <p>Throughout my tech journey, I have always tried to look for new opportunities to learn and challenge myself to become a better engineer.</p>
                <p>I built this portfolio site so that visitors might get a better opportunity to see and interact with some of my work.</p>
