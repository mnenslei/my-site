            <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Michael Enslein. <br/> I am a fullstack web developer.</h1>
            <p>Recently, I graduated from the Bloom Institute of Technology (fka Lambda School) and I am an alumnus of Indiana University-Bloomington, where I graduated from the Kelley School of Business.</p>
            <p>Throughout my tech journey I have learned that practice makes perfect and I enjoy every second of putting in my reps to become a better engineer.</p>
            <p>I built this portfolio site so that visitors may get a sense for my growth and journey in the engineering space.</p>
            <p>So please, feel free to have a look around and if you would like to collaborate with me or have any questions please connect with me using any of the available options below in the footer.</p>
